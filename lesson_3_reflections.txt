Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: There may be changes made to the master branch (or any branch) that one might
not want to merge. There is also more control.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
A: Forks are essentially clones but are created via GitHub. Forks make sure that
the original authors are acknowledged. Clones are copies of repos that have no
record of the original author. Clones are created using git. Branches are
variations of a master branch. They are created using git.
